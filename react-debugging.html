<!-- ASSESSMENT 3: React Debugging Challenge -->

<!-- This file contains a React component in an HTML file. This React code is broken. Fix the THREE bugs in the code so the user can draw cards and reset the deck. Note: The component is correctly described in this file structure. There is no need to change the architecture of any code. -->

<!-- To see this app render, open the file in your browser by going to file >> open file >> and finding the appropriate file location. -->

<!-- HINT: Check the console in the browser developer tools for errors. The lines numbers may not match up exactly with the line numbers in your text editor. -->

<!--Notes-->
<!-- 3 bugs within the return of the App component -->
<!-- 1. The JSX fragment pieces were missing. <></> VS Code could not recognize any of the code within the return because it was not incased in JSX.  -->
<!-- 2. Line 82, the button onClick did not receive a parameter inside the {}. Without an attribute passed, in this case it was the drawCard method, when clicking the button, the function would not execute as intended.  -->
<!-- 3. Line 85, the onclick was incorrectly written. onClick needs to be written in camelCase because its within JSX fragments.  -->
